- what is use of remoteng?

	-Python script to decrypt passwords stored by mRemoteNG
	-Simple multi-remote web interface for LIRC setups. (Linux Infrared remote control)

- what is subprocess?

	-- It is used to run new applications or programs through Python code by creating new process.
	-- Popen() method is used to give the command and we will get the output.
	-- It helps to obtain the stdin/stdout/stderr/return code as well as the exist codes of various commands
	-- syntax: output = subprocess.run("ping www.google.com", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, encoding="utf-8", shell=True)
	-- We have run method in subprocess:
	   - First argument is input/command
	   - Second argument is output of the command
	   - Third argument is Encoding (bytes to string)
	   - Next it will check the shell(as python program to execute this command on command prompt)
	   - It will check whether it is stdout/stderr /return code 
	   - return always should be non-zero, it means command executed successfully.

- what is the use of paramiko

	-- To transfer a file from local server to remote server & vice-versa using paramiko module in python
	-- On windows to install paramiko  we will use , pip install paramiko in command prompt
	-- SSH is the method typically used to access a remote machine and run commands, retrieve files or upload files.
	-- You can transfer files using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and SCP(Secure Copy Protocol).
	-- MAKING A CONNECTION : 
			import paramiko
			ssh_client=paramiko.SSHClient()
			ssh_client.connect(hostname=’hostname’,username=’username’,password=’mypassword’,port='')

	-- Downloading a file from remote machine

			sftp_client=ssh_client.open_sftp()
			sftp_client.get(‘remotefileth’,’localfilepath’)
			sftp_client.close()
			
			
	-- Uploading file from local to remote machine
			sftp_client=ssh.open_sftp()
			sftp_client.put(‘localfilepath’,remotefilepath’)
			sftp_client.close()


- what are the basic types in python

	-Numeric,Sequence type, boolean , set , Dictionary
	
- What is decorator?

	 - A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as its argument, and returns yet another function.
	 - Decorators can be extremely useful as they allow the extension of an existing function, without any modification to the original function source code.
	 - This is also called metaprogramming because a part of the program tries to modify another part of the program at compile time.
	 
	 Example:
		def first(msg):
			print(msg)


		first("Hello")

		second = first
		second("Hello")
	
	 O/P:
		Hello
		Hello
		
- Can you tell me what is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?

	-A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
	-A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

- Can you explain about generator?

	- In python generators are simple way of creating iterators
	- Generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).
	- The generator function cannot include the return keyword.

- Can you tell me about list comprehension?

	-It is a very concise way to create a new list by performing an operation on each item in the existing list.
	
	Example:
	 - In the following example print letter "a" in the name.
	 
		fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

		newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

		print(newlist)
		
	O/P:
	   ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
		

- When you use regex module?

	- We will use the regular expression for matching purpose in our project.
	- A regular expression is used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters.
	
- Have you use match and search funtion?

- Can you explain difference between search and match function?

	- Search checks for a match anywhere in the string
	- Match checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, 

- What is the difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance?

	- Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits from many base classes
	- Multilevel Inheritance is when a class inherits from a derived class making that derived class a base class for a new class.

- What is singleton function?

	-Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

- datatypes in python and dict data types

	Text Type:	str
	Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
	Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
	Mapping Type:	dict
	Set Types:	set, frozenset
	Boolean Type:	bool
	Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
	None Type:	NoneType
	
	-Any type of value can be used as a dictionary key in Python.

- diff btw list and tuple

	- Tuples are immutable objects the lists are mutable.
	- list is time taken process compare to tuple in the time of iteration
	- List consume more memory compare to tuple
	

- diff btw mutable and immutable

	- An object whose internal state can be changed is mutable.
	-immutable doesn't allow any change in the object once it has been created

- explian about request module

	- Requests module allows us to send HTTP requests using Python.
	- The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
	- When one makes a request to a URI, it returns a response. 

- explain about functional testing.
	- A functional test is a form of an integration test that runs the Python application “literally.”
	- Functional test checks the code from beginning to end
	
- explain about lambda function
	
	-A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

	-A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
	
	Syntax:
	
		- lambda arguments : expression
	
	Example:
		
		x = lambda a : a + 10
		print(x(5))
